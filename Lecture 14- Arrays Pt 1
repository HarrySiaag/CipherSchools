ARRAYS PART-1

Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has a contiguous memory location.

The array is an indexed collection of a finite number of homogenous elements.

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. 
Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.
It is a data structure where we store similar elements.
We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on the 1st index, and so on.

1. Declaration and Initialization

In Java, an array is declared by specifying the type of elements it will hold, followed by square brackets []. 
For example: int[] myArray;. To initialize an array, you can use the new keyword followed by the type and size of the array, like this: int[] myArray = new int[5];. 
This creates an array of 5 integers.

2. Indexing and Accessing Elements

Arrays in Java are 0-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, and the last element is at index length - 1. 
You can access an element at a specific index using the square brackets [] and the index value, like this: myArray[0] = 10;. 
This sets the first element of the array to 10.

3. Array Length

In Java, the length of an array is fixed and cannot be changed after it's created. 
You can get the length of an array using the length property, like this: int length = myArray.length;. 
This returns the number of elements in the array.

4. Default Values

When an array is created, its elements are initialized with default values. 
For example, an int array will have all elements initialized to 0, a boolean array will have all elements initialized to false, 
and an Object array will have all elements initialized to null.
