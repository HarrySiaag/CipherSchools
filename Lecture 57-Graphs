Graphs in Java:
In Java, a graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes or vertices connected by edges. 
Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects, making them a fundamental concept in computer science. 

Here's a concise introduction to graphs in Java:

Types of Graphs:
Undirected Graph: Edges do not have direction, and the graph is symmetric.
Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have direction, and the graph is asymmetric.
Weighted Graph: Edges have weights or labels associated with them.
Unweighted Graph: Edges do not have weights or labels.

Graph Representations in Java:
Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where matrix[i][j] represents the edge between vertices i and j.
Adjacency List: A list of edges, where each edge is represented as a pair of vertices.

Common Graph Operations:
Traversal: Visiting nodes in a specific order (e.g., Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)).
Shortest Path: Finding the minimum distance between two nodes (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
Minimum Spanning Tree: Finding the subset of edges that connect all nodes with minimum total weight.

Java Implementations:
Java Collections Framework: The java.util package provides classes like ArrayList and LinkedList for graph implementation.
Third-party libraries: Libraries like JGraphT, GraphStream, and Apache Commons Graph provide more comprehensive graph functionality.

Key Concepts:
Graph Theory: Understanding graph terminology, such as nodes, edges, and connectivity.
Algorithmic Complexity: Analyzing the time and space complexity of graph algorithms.
Graph Visualization: Visualizing graphs to better understand their structure and behavior.
