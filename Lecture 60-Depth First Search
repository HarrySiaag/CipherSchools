DEPTH FIRST SEARCH


What is Depth-First Search (DFS)?
Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph or a tree by visiting a node and then visiting all of its neighbors before backtracking. 
It's called "depth-first" because it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

How does DFS work in Java?
In Java, DFS can be implemented using a recursive function or an iterative approach using a stack. 

Here's a high-level outline of the steps:
-Choose a starting node (also called the root node) in the graph.
-Mark the starting node as visited.
-Explore the node's neighbors that have not been visited yet.
-Recursively visit each unvisited neighbor until all nodes have been visited.
-Backtrack to the previous node until the starting node is reached again.
