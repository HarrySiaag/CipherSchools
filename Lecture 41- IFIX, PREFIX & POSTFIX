IFIX, PREFIX & POSTFIX

Infix Notation: 
In infix notation, operators are placed between their operands. 
This is the conventional notation used in arithmetic expressions. 
For example: a + b or x * y. In Java, infix notation is used to write expressions, and the compiler evaluates them according to the operator precedence rules.

Prefix Notation: 
In prefix notation, operators are placed before their operands. 
For example: + a b or * x y. This notation is also known as Polish notation. 
While not commonly used in Java programming, prefix notation is used in some specialized applications, such as parsing and evaluating expressions.

Postfix Notation: 
In postfix notation, operators are placed after their operands. 
For example: a b + or x y *. This notation is also known as Reverse Polish notation. 
Postfix notation is used in some specialized applications, such as stack-based evaluators and calculators. 
In Java, postfix notation can be used to implement stack-based algorithms for evaluating expressions.



//code

{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String infix = "3+4*5";
        String infix2 = "3*4+5";
        System.out.println(infixToPost(infix));
        System.out.println(infixToPost(infix2));
    }
    static String infixToPostfix(String infix)
    {
        String res = "";
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack();
        for(int i=0;i<infix.length();i++)
        {
            char c = infix.charAt(i);
            if(Character.isDigit(c))
            {
                res = res+c;
            }
            else
            {
                stack.push();
            }
        }
    }
