Objects and Classes in Java

Classes

A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object.
A class is essentially a design pattern that defines the characteristics of an object, including its data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
In Java, a class is defined using the class keyword followed by the name of the class.

Objects

An object is an instance of a class, and it represents a real-world entity or concept.
Objects have their own set of attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that are defined by the class.
Objects are created using the new keyword followed by the name of the class.

Key Concepts

Inheritance: A class can inherit the properties and behavior of another class using the extends keyword.
Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
Encapsulation: Classes can hide their internal implementation details and expose only the necessary information to the outside world.
Abstraction: Classes can represent complex real-world concepts in a simplified way.

Class Components

Fields (or Attributes): These are the data members of a class, which are used to store the state of an object.
Methods: These are the functions that define the behavior of an object.
Constructors: These are special methods that are used to initialize objects when they are created.

Object Creation
Default Constructor: A constructor that takes no arguments and is used to create an object with default values.
Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes one or more arguments and is used to create an object with specific values.

Access Modifiers

Public: Members that are accessible from anywhere in the program.
Private: Members that are accessible only within the same class.
Protected: Members that are accessible within the same class and its subclasses.
Default (or Package-Private): Members that are accessible within the same package.
